# simpleLang-compiler-for-8Bit-CPU-Assembler

This is the documentation of the development and the implementation of my compiler(simpleLang) which converts the code written in a high level language called simpleLang into an assembly code which is compatible with the assembler program created for the 8bit CPU by the repository creator of https://github.com/lightcode/8bit-computer

# The process of the development includes
1. creating a lexer
2. creating a parser 
3. creating a codegenerator
4. creating a main.cpp file which can direct the working of parser, lexer and codegenerator

# understanding the problem
The goal of the compiler is to create a compiler that can convert my simpleLang code into an assembly code which is compatible with the asm/asm.py file so that it can convert the code into an assembly code which is according to the format of the cpu(such as the "tests/multiplication_test.asm")

# understanding lexer

lexer analysis is the first stage of the the compilation. It's job is to identify the tokens from the high level code written by us. It then forms a sequence of valid tokens. The process of identification of a part of code as whether it is token or not is the job of lexer.

Example: If you have the simpleLang code int a = 10;, the lexer would produce tokens like:
INT (keyword)
IDENTIFIER (for 'a')
ASSIGN (for '=')
NUMBER (for '10')
SEMICOLON

# understanfing parser

The parser converts the sequence of tokens generated by the lexer, and forms an AST-Abstract Syntax Tree. the AST represents the logical relation between different tokens and the grammatical structure as well.

Example: For the code int a = 10;, the parser might create an AST node of type VAR_DECL with two children:
An IDENTIFIER node for 'a'
A NUMBER node for '10'

# understanding codegnerator

The code generator takes the AST generated by the parser and translates it into assembly code for your 8-bit CPU. It maps the high-level constructs of simpleLang (like variable declarations, assignments, and if statements) into equivalent low-level assembly instructions.

# the main.cpp file

this file defines how to direct the lexer, parser and the code generator to operate  correctly. This is the driver code of the compiler.

In my compiler, I have defined the compiler to  ->
Reads the simpleLang source code.
Call the lexer to generate tokens.
Call the parser to create the AST.
Call the code generator to produce assembly code.
Write the assembly code to an output file.
