# simpleLang-compiler-for-8Bit-CPU-Assembler

This is the documentation of the development and the implementation of my compiler which converts the code written in a high level language called simpleLang into an assembly code which is compatibl with the assembler program created for the 8bit CPU by the repository creator of https://github.com/lightcode/8bit-computer

The process of the development includes
1. creating a parser 
2. creating a lexer
3. creating a codegenerator
4. creating a main.cpp file which can direct the working of parser, lexer and codegenerator
